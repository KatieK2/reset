#~~reset~~ v0.0.5

I don't like resets - I find them too overreaching in many cases. This files provides a CSS normalizer and some base styling; both in CSS and SCSS.

 * normalize: Standardizes UA rendering without completely de-styling the document.
 * base: CSS file to include many basic styling niceties.
 
Also includes demo HTML files showing all elements and their styling.

Browser support: IE8, FF4, SF4 and above

###Sass
Compile .scss files with: `sass --watch ./:./ --style compact`
